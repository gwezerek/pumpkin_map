Our Brandy Barrel-Aged Imperial Pumpkin Ale pays homage to Lakefront’s formative years and to our Wisconsin roots. It pours a copper-orange with a fine, off-white head. The aroma is caramel-forward, followed by cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, oak, and subtle brandy notes. The full, moderately bright mouthfeel starts  with cinnamon, nutmeg, and caramel malt, then yields Madagascar vanilla bean, oak, and brandy flavors. A lingering oak and malty sweetness are left on the palate; a reminder of how we’ve honed our craft over the years.


Like our Pumpkin Lager, this goes great with fall meals, but the intense flavors demand richer foods. Roasted or glazed foul will pair excellently: we suggest honey glazed turkey or roasted duck. Try sweet potato and butternut squash hash as a side, or a spiced butternut squash purée. Also a great a dessert beer: serve it with French vanilla ice cream topped with maple glazed walnuts or a simple bread pudding with dried cranberry and pecans.",0,https://d1c8v1qci5en44.cloudfront.net/site/beer_logos/beer-788497_740e8_sm.jpeg,Pumpkin / Yam Beer,769,https://d1c8v1qci5en44.cloudfront.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-LakefrontBrewery_769.jpeg,lakefront,http://www.lakefrontbrewery.com,United States,Milwaukee,43.0551,-87.9053
